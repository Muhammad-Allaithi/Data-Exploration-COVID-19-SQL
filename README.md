# Data-Exploration-COVID-19-SQL
## Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths Project - Data Exploration
This SQL project explores global COVID-19 death data by using advanced SQL techniques like joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregate functions. It analyzes infection and death rates by country and continent, calculating death likelihood and population infection percentages. The script highlights countries with the highest cases and deaths, offering comprehensive insights into the pandemic's global impact.

## Skills Used
- Joins: Combining data from multiple tables.
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Simplifying complex queries.
- Window Functions: Performing calculations across sets of table rows.
- Aggregate Functions: Summarizing data (e.g., SUM(), MAX(), COUNT()).
- Creating Views: Reusable query results as virtual tables.
- Data Type Conversions: Transforming data formats for better analysis.

## Processes
- Initial Data Retrieval: Querying COVID-19 case and death data by country and date.
- Total Cases vs Total Deaths: Calculating the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19.
- Total Cases vs Population: Determining the percentage of each country's population infected by COVID-19.
- Countries with Highest Infection Rates: Identifying nations with the most cases relative to their population size.
- Countries with Highest Death Count: Highlighting countries with the largest number of deaths.
- Continent-Level Analysis: Breaking down death counts by continent to compare global regions.
- Global Statistics: Summarizing total cases and deaths on a global scale.

## Final Conclusion
This script offers insightful analyses on how COVID-19 impacted various countries and regions, providing a clear view of infection and death rates across the globe. It uses advanced SQL techniques to deliver comprehensive data insights from the pandemic.
